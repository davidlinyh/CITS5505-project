Each function can be considered as a unit.

NOTE:
***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
* Uncomment a test you want to run and copy-paste it below def teardown_method(): or at line 21. (If you run the whole test, it would take some time to run:( ).

* Please have the app running.

* Please install Chrome as I have used Chrome drivers to test.

* While testing, For the Manage-Account page, Paste your Absolute path to agileapp/app/static/profile_photos at line number () or you could have a folder of photos yourself, mine is:
  C:\Users\adhar\Desktop\sem3\cits5505\Group project\1\CITS5505-project\agileapp\app\static\profile_photos

* While testing, for the New item page, Paste your Absolute path to agileapp/app/static/profile_photos/{any photo} at line number () or you could use any photo as you wish, mine is:
  C:\Users\adhar\Desktop\sem3\cits5505\Group project\1\CITS5505-project\agileapp\app\static\item_photos\sample_photo.JPG

To run the tests, 
* Open the command prompt/prompt/terminal and install pytest, if not already installed (pip install pytest).
* You may have to set your path variables right, if it still shows pytest is not a callable command.
* Once pytest is installed successfully if a terminal is open, switch to the same directory where this readme file is located or open a new terminal in this directory.
* Just type pytest and press ENTER.
* You should see the number of test cases passed (hopefully all).
